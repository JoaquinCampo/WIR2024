Ever since I've been old enough to know how the American government works, I've been a Democrat, and I don't see that changing in the near future. But this is the first time I've really felt this scared about the outcome of an election. And yes, that includes 2016. In 2016 I knew there was a chance Trump could win, but I was still shocked when it actually happened. And in 2020 I predicted-- correctly, as it turns out-- that he would lose to Joe Biden. But now it's 2023, and I'm not feeling optimistic at all about the 2024 election. And there are multiple reasons for that. Biden's polls are exceptionally bad, especially for an incumbent President. Normally it's tough to beat an incumbent, but people really don't like Biden. He's even falling behind Trump in key swing states he won in 2020, which is astonishing. Demographics that went for Biden in 2020 are starting to turn away from him, especially in the aforementioned swing states. Even if Trump is convicted in one of his upcoming trials, it's unlikely to affect him badly. At worst, his voters base will use it as an excuse to play the victim, and will turn out in droves on election day. Biden has no similar way of exciting his voters. The Israel-Hamas war has no end in sight, and is costing Biden a great deal of support with both Muslim and Jewish voters. To truly CMV on this, you'll have to do so on all four of the above points. As it stands, I think Trump is in a much better position to win than Biden is, and anyone who claims otherwise is simply delusional. - According to the social security administration, a 77 year old man in the US has a 4.9% chance dying in the next year. An 81 year old man has a 7.2% chance of dying in the next year https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html People are so sure what is going to happen in November 2024, but there is lots of time for shit of change. The chance that at least one of Trump or Biden becomes really sick or drops dead is not trivial. Just like the Israel/Palestine was not on anyones radar on October 6th (just over two months ago), there are plenty of time for other issues to dominate national conversation. This far out from the 2020 election, no one in the US was aware of COVID, yet that was a key issue in 2020. The campaign season hasn't started yet, the goal isn't to convince voters to like you in December 2023, it s to convince voters to like you in October/November 2024. Its way premature to consider anything settled - Your death stats are based on the whole population average. Which includes tons of people unable to afford full health care. Not only that but presidents are part of the 1%... meaning they get extra ultra full premium health care. In other words, your stats are worth zilch. Try again but this time with the death stats of only the 1%. Good luck finding those, tough. On your second point, in general anytime bad stuff happens, it is the populist candidate that looks decisive and strong, which will gain more traction over the softer spoken man using reason rather than emotional angry feelings. Anytime some bad stuff occurs, it is the president holding power taking thee blame, not the runner ups. And with the current world dynamics getting hotter and hotter in many parts of the world, the odds of anything bad NOT happening in 2024 until november, or even of MULTIPLE bad thing not happening, are super low. So, if anything, the odds of thing swinging even *more* than they already are towards Trump are magnitudes bigger than the oppsoite. My own uneducated personal take on why? Two reasons. People are getting more than fed up with the ultra wokeness agendas constantly being hammered in their face, things on that side have gone way too far to the point of denaturing the original message. And they are starting to fight back. On that front, this extreme liberalism is associated with the dems and the republicans feel like the 'simple' solution to those actually extremely complex issues. Second reason: the economy is really bad. The dems, with their ever big spending on goverrnment programs and mommy care state and increasing government size, and their soft approach on crime, don't feel like they are going to adsress this at all. Meanwhile the republicansd with their ever promises of cutting spending and gov size, feel like they are gonbg to fix the economy. But actually they have rarely ever done anything of the sort: they instead are the ones opening even more paths to funnel even more money towards the big pockets their already rich friends. Note also that once in power the dems cdo NOT close up the new funnels. In terms of protecting the overall economy for the middle class (and we all know a STRONG middle class is the real backbone and muscle of any country), it turns out that both parties are just as bad. But the US is forever locked in choosing between two differently flavored sides of the same shitty coin. I predict Ttump wins. Then proceeds to get his revenge while tearing down a *lot* of 'democratic' stuff. Some of which indeed needs to go, yes, but overall he'll act more like an elephant in a porcelain store, than an experienced surgeon perating to remove a cancer tumor. I expect more violence, that he will use to justify even more authoritarian actions. He won't try to remain forever in power, though, instead leave with TONS of money from all his scammings. The guy is actually in debt, not 'rich'. Buit the damage will remain, on both sides.- Please precisely define 'ultra wokeness.' Because as I understand it, it is just real world stuff that Republicans want/need a safe space from and are upset that their safe space is no longer all of US produced entertainment Also, the US has experienced the lowest inflation of any major nation in the world in the last year. People don't want to talk about how taxes are higher this year because of Trump's tax bill during his time in office. And it is hard for the Democrats to close the rich get richer funnels that Republicans make when Republicans are willing to cause a federal government shutdown any time Democrats try to do anything that might affect a Republican politicians wallet. Not that there aren't corrupt people on the Democrats side, but it is pretty clear which party has gone beyond any hope of ever helping the average American and which is still trying. Idk how any decent American can vote Republican ",  text_pair=aspect))
